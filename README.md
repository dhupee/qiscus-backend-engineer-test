# Qiscus Backend Engineer Test

## Question

```txt
Dear Daffa Haj Tsaqif﻿

Thank you for your interest in joining Qiscus as a Backend Engineer. After careful consideration, we would like to proceed with you to the Technical Test stage.
Below is the test we typically give to Backend Engineer candidates. Please complete the following test and submit your results by max. 2 days (Sunday, October 13th, 2024)
A. Section I
QUESTIONS
Illustrate a mechanism diagram for a Chatting system in both group or single chat settings.
Depict the database structure for the above points.
In your opinion, how does real-time chat communication work?
Please answer the questions below in PDF format.

B. Section II
Challenge Description:
We look forward to reviewing your solution and learning more about your coding abilities.
You are presented with a sequence of integers from 1 to N. For each number, your task is to determine how many divisors it has. Your goal is to write a function that computes the number of divisors for each number from 1 to N and prints a summary.
However, there’s a twist: for numbers with an even number of divisors, we consider them 'special numbers.' At the end of the function, you should count how many 'special numbers' exist between 1 and N (i.e., numbers that have an even number of divisors).
Instructions:
Write a function that, given an integer N, determines how many divisors each number between 1 and N has.
Count how many numbers between 1 and N have an even number of divisors.
Your solution should be optimized to handle large values of N.
Save your code in a GitHub Gist.
Provide a link to your GitHub Gist that we can access, and save the link in PDF format.
If you have any questions or need further clarification on the task, feel free to reach out to us.
